>   How Are You Doing is a website made to track the mood of a user. This is done by asking 10 questions to the user, and have them pull a dropdown from 0 through 10. This allows the user to get a total once they have completed all the questions. They are then taken to a page where they can see cards of dates, quotes, and the delete button.
